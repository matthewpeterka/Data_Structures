# Custom C++ Data Structures Library

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a custom implementation of standard C++ data structures, designed to provide a deeper understanding of data structure fundamentals. The goal of this project is to recreate commonly used data structures from the C++ Standard Library, such as vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, while emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and educational value.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to provide a resource for learning and teaching data structures in C++. By recreating these data structures from scratch, users can gain a deeper understanding of how these structures work under the hood, how to implement them, and how to use them effectively.

Key motivations include:

Education: This project is a learning resource for C++ programmers interested in data structures and algorithms.
Clarity: Code in this repository is designed to be clear and well-documented, making it accessible to learners at various skill levels.
Customization: Users can modify and extend the code to suit specific requirements or experiment with different data structure variations.
Comparative Analysis: By studying both the standard library and custom implementations side by side, users can appreciate the strengths and trade-offs of different design choices.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

include/: Contains the header files for custom data structures.
src/: Implementation files for the custom data structures.
examples/: Example code demonstrating how to use the custom data structures.
tests/: Unit tests to verify the correctness of data structures.
CMakeLists.txt: The CMake configuration file for building the project.
LICENSE: The project's license file (see License).
